## BLE Flooding “Mesh-like” Demo (MicroPython Pico W)

This lab uses **BLE advertisements** (broadcast) + **scanning** (receive). It is **not Bluetooth SIG BLE Mesh**; we are building a **mesh-like flooding relay** at the application layer.

### Key terms (use these consistently)

* **Inject**: originate a new message (new `MSGID`, `ORIG = me`)
* **Advertise burst**: transmit that message for a short time window (here **300 ms**) then stop
* **Forward**: advertise a message that originated from someone else

---

## Frame format

We encode frames as short text (kept small to fit in advertising name field):

```
M1|ORIG|MSGID|TTL|TYPE|DATA
```

Example:

```
M1|a1b2c3|12345678|3|T|26.73
```

## Functions: What it does

Briefly explains what each function does.

| Function                          | What it does                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `read_temp_c()`                   | Reads the Pico W’s internal temperature sensor and returns the temperature value used as the message payload. |
| `make_frame(...)`                 | Creates a message in the format `M1                                                                           |
| `parse_frame(s)`                  | Checks and extracts fields from a received message string. Invalid messages are ignored.                      |
| `adv_payload_name(...)`           | Builds a BLE advertising packet that carries the message inside the device name field.                        |
| `frame_to_name(frame)`            | Shortens a message so it fits safely inside BLE advertising data.                                             |
| `Node.__init__()`                 | Sets up BLE, starts scanning, initialises state, and prints the node’s unique ID.                             |
| `Node._rand_jitter_s()`           | Adds a small random delay so nodes do not all send messages at the same time.                                 |
| `Node.advertise_burst_start(...)` | Advertises a message for a short time window to simulate sending it once.                                     |
| `Node.advertise_burst_service()`  | Stops advertising after the burst time has expired.                                                           |
| `Node.scan()`                     | Listens for BLE advertisements from nearby nodes.                                                             |
| `Node._irq(...)`                  | Processes BLE events, including receiving messages and (in later parts) forwarding them.                      |
| `Node.run()`                      | Main loop that controls message injection, advertising, and scanning.                                         |

# Part 1 — Send new data and listen (no forwarding)

Goal:

* Each node **injects** a new temperature frame **once per minute** (+ jitter)
* Each node **listens** and prints received frames
* **No forwarding** of received frames

### 1A) Add `inject_own()` inside the class

Insert under “INSERT PART-SPECIFIC CODE BELOW”.

```python
    def inject_own(self):
        temp = read_temp_c()
        data = "{:.2f}".format(temp)
        msgid = str(time.ticks_ms() & 0xFFFFFFFF)

        # TTL not used in Part 1; set 0 to make it clear there is no hop logic yet
        frame = make_frame(NODE_ID, msgid, 0, "T", data)

        # Advertise only once per injection = 300 ms burst
        self.advertise_burst_start(frame)
        print("INJECT:", frame)

        # Schedule next injection: 60s + jitter
        self.next_inject_ms = time.ticks_add(
            time.ticks_ms(),
            (INJECT_PERIOD_S + self._rand_jitter_s()) * 1000
        )
```

### 1B) Replace `_irq()` to print received frames

Replace the template `_irq()` with:

```python
    def _irq(self, event, data):
        if event == _IRQ_SCAN_RESULT:
            addr_type, addr, adv_type, rssi, adv_data = data
            try:
                raw = bytes(adv_data)
                idx = raw.find(b"M1|")
                if idx == -1:
                    return
                s = raw[idx:].decode("utf-8", "ignore").split("\x00")[0]
            except:
                return

            parsed = parse_frame(s)
            if not parsed:
                return

            orig, msgid, ttl, typ, payload = parsed
            print("RX (rssi={}): orig={} type={} data={}".format(rssi, orig, typ, payload))

        elif event == _IRQ_SCAN_DONE:
            self.scan()
```

### 1C) Update `run()` to inject on schedule

Inside the `run()` loop, under “INSERT PART-SPECIFIC LOOP LOGIC HERE”, insert:

```python
            now = time.ticks_ms()
            if time.ticks_diff(now, self.next_inject_ms) >= 0:
                self.inject_own()
```

Expected behaviour:

* `INJECT:` appears roughly every 60–70 seconds (because of jitter)
* `RX:` appears when another node is injecting nearby
* Message can appear twice as BLE broadcast can transmit multiple times even though you 'inject' once.

---

# Part 2 — Forward received data (ignore duplicates and TTL)

Goal:

* Make multi-hop propagation obvious
* Intentionally flawed: no dedupe, no TTL (expect “ping-pong” / storms)

### 2A) Add a simple forward function

Insert in the class:

```python
    def forward_raw(self, raw_frame_str):
        # Forward exactly what we received (intentionally wrong for Part 2)
        self.advertise_burst_start(raw_frame_str)
        print("FWD:", raw_frame_str)
```

### 2B) Modify `_irq()` to forward all received frames

In `_IRQ_SCAN_RESULT`, after printing RX, add:

```python
            self.forward_raw(s)
```

Expected behaviour:

* One injected message can create repeated transmissions due to forwarding
* With 2 nodes, the packet can ping-pong indefinitely

---

# Part 3 — Loop Control: Remove Duplicates and Bound Propagation

In Part 2, packets were forwarded indefinitely, even with only two nodes.
This happened because forwarding nodes had **no memory** and **no hop limit**.

In Part 3, we add the **minimum control mechanisms** required for any flooding-based mesh-like protocol. Add two essential controls used in real mesh and routing protocols:

Goal:

1. **De-duplication**
   Remember which messages have already been processed using a cache keyed by
   `(ORIG, MSGID)`.

2. **TTL (Time-To-Live)**
   Limit how far a message can propagate by decrementing a hop counter on each forward.

Together, these ensure that **every message eventually stops**.

---

## 3A — Add a de-duplication helper

Each message is uniquely identified by:

```
(ORIG, MSGID)
```

If a node sees the same pair again, the message must be dropped.

Insert the following helper inside the `Node` class:

```python
    def seen_check_add(self, key):
        if key in self.seen:
            return True      # already seen → drop
        self.seen.append(key)
        if len(self.seen) > SEEN_MAX:
            del self.seen[0:len(self.seen) - SEEN_MAX]
        return False         # first time seen
```

This gives the node a **short-term memory**.

---

## 3B — Update injection: include TTL and mark own packet as seen

When a node **injects** a new message, it must immediately remember it.

Otherwise, when the node later hears its own message (via self-scan or a bounce from another node), it would appear “new” and be forwarded again.

Modify `inject_own()` as follows:

1. Use `DEFAULT_TTL` instead of `0`
2. Add the injected message to the `seen` cache

```python
        frame = make_frame(NODE_ID, msgid, DEFAULT_TTL, "T", data)

        # IMPORTANT: mark injected packet as already seen
        self.seen_check_add("{}:{}".format(NODE_ID, msgid))

        self.advertise_burst_start(frame)
        print("INJECT:", frame)
```

This step is critical.
Without it, nodes will forward their **own** packets.

---

## 3C — Replace raw forwarding with TTL-based forwarding

Forwarded messages must:

* decrement the TTL
* stop propagating when TTL reaches zero

Add the following function inside the class:

```python
    def forward_ttl(self, orig, msgid, ttl, typ, payload):
        ttl2 = ttl - 1
        if ttl2 < 0:
            return            # message dies here

        fwd = make_frame(orig, msgid, ttl2, typ, payload)
        self.advertise_burst_start(fwd)
        print("FWD ttl={}: {}".format(ttl2, fwd))
```

This ensures messages have a **finite lifetime**.

---

## 3D — Update `_irq()` to apply de-duplication and TTL forwarding

Inside `_IRQ_SCAN_RESULT`, after parsing the frame:

### 1. De-duplicate using `(ORIG, MSGID)`

```python
            key = "{}:{}".format(orig, msgid)
            if self.seen_check_add(key):
                return
```

### 2. Deliver the message locally

```python
            print("RX NEW (rssi={}): orig={} ttl={} type={} data={}".format(
                rssi, orig, ttl, typ, payload
            ))
```

### 3. Forward only if TTL allows

```python
            if ttl > 0:
                self.forward_ttl(orig, msgid, ttl, typ, payload)
```

---

## 3E — Remove `forward_raw()` as its not needed anymore

That’s Part 2 code. It won’t break anything, but for a “final Part 3”, remove it to avoid accidentally calling it.

---

## What students should observe

After Part 3:

* Each message appears **once** per node
* Messages propagate a limited distance
* No infinite ping-pong, even with only two nodes
* Reducing `DEFAULT_TTL` visibly reduces how far messages travel

---

## Key takeaway

> Flooding without memory and hop limits loops forever.
> Adding de-duplication and TTL is the minimum requirement for stability.

This is why **every real mesh or routing protocol** includes both mechanisms.
